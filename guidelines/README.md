# FastMCP Guidelines for AI Development

This directory contains comprehensive guidelines extracted from the official FastMCP documentation, structured specifically for AI consumption and development workflows.

## Directory Structure

### üìö Foundation
Essential concepts and setup information for getting started with FastMCP.

- **[core-concepts.md](foundation/core-concepts.md)** - Core FastMCP concepts, purpose, components, and design philosophy
- **[installation.md](foundation/installation.md)** - Installation methods, version management, and setup best practices
- **[quickstart.md](foundation/quickstart.md)** - Basic implementation patterns and development workflows

### üèóÔ∏è Server Development
Architecture and deployment patterns for FastMCP servers.

- **[architecture.md](server-development/architecture.md)** - Server components, configuration, modular composition, and architectural patterns
- **[deployment.md](server-development/deployment.md)** - Execution methods, transport configuration, and production deployment strategies

### üîß Components
Core building blocks of FastMCP applications.

- **[tools.md](components/tools.md)** - Tool implementation, parameter handling, error management, and async patterns
- **[context.md](components/context.md)** - Context management, logging, progress tracking, and state handling
- **[logging.md](components/logging.md)** - Logging levels, structured logging, and monitoring best practices

### üöÄ Advanced Patterns
Sophisticated development patterns and best practices.

- **[method-decoration.md](advanced-patterns/method-decoration.md)** - Class method registration, decoration patterns, and common pitfalls
- **[testing.md](advanced-patterns/testing.md)** - Testing strategies, mocking, and quality assurance practices

## How to Use These Guidelines

### For AI Agents
Each file is structured with:
- Clear implementation patterns and examples
- Standards and best practices sections
- Code samples with explanations
- Error handling and security considerations

### For Development Workflows
1. Start with **Foundation** for basic understanding
2. Reference **Server Development** for architecture decisions
3. Use **Components** for implementation details
4. Apply **Advanced Patterns** for complex scenarios

### Quick Reference
- **New to FastMCP?** ‚Üí Start with `foundation/core-concepts.md` and `foundation/quickstart.md`
- **Building a server?** ‚Üí Check `server-development/architecture.md` and `components/tools.md`
- **Deployment planning?** ‚Üí Review `server-development/deployment.md`
- **Testing implementation?** ‚Üí Follow `advanced-patterns/testing.md`
- **Complex class integration?** ‚Üí See `advanced-patterns/method-decoration.md`

## Standards Applied

All guidelines follow these principles:
- **Practical Examples**: Real code patterns that work
- **Error Prevention**: Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- **Security-First**: Best practices for secure implementations
- **Performance-Aware**: Efficient patterns and optimization guidance
- **AI-Optimized**: Clear, structured information for AI decision-making
