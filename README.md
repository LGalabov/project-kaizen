# Project Kaizen

*MCP server that elevates transient AI interactions into a persistent foundation of organizational knowledge*

## Project Overview

Project Kaizen enables AI agents to maintain persistent knowledge across sessions, transforming them from stateless assistants into learning team members with deep project understanding.

## Documentation

### üìã [Product Specification](./project-kaizen-product-specification.md)
The complete product vision, use cases, and expected behaviors. **Start here** to understand what we're building and why.

### üìñ [Behavior Examples](./behavior-examples.md)
Detailed examples of how the AI agent should behave with the memory system in various scenarios.

### üèóÔ∏è [Multi-Project Products](./multi-project-products.md)
How the system handles products with multiple repositories and the four-tier knowledge architecture.

## Core Concept

Without this system, every AI agent session starts from zero. With it, the AI agent:
- Remembers project context and decisions
- Learns from failures to prevent repetition
- Accumulates team knowledge over time
- Becomes more effective with each interaction

Knowledge enters through three simple triggers:
1. User teaching sessions (can include research)
2. Voluntary additions after successful tasks
3. Approved proposals after failures

Designed for small trusted teams and individual developers.

## Value Proposition

- **For Developers**: No more re-explaining context every session
- **For Teams**: Institutional knowledge preserved and accessible
- **For Projects**: Faster delivery with fewer repeated mistakes

## Project Status

This is a product specification and vision document. Implementation details will follow after the product vision is validated and refined.
