# MCP Server Implementation Plan v2 - Post-MVP Enhancements

**ðŸŽ¯ IMPORTANT**: This TODO v2 contains enhancements to be implemented **AFTER** the main TODO.md is completed and MVP is released.

## Current Status
- **MVP Path**: Complete TODO.md first (CHUNKS 1-7) for functional MCP server
- **Production Path**: Then implement TODO-v2.md for full MCP specification compliance and production readiness

## Post-MVP Enhancement Chunks

### **CHUNK 1.6: MCP Resources & Prompts** [POST-MVP]
**Purpose**: Achieve full MCP specification compliance by implementing Resources and Prompts

**Deliverables**:
- `src/project_kaizen/resources.py` - Expose knowledge entries as MCP resources
- `src/project_kaizen/prompts.py` - Workflow templates for common knowledge tasks
- `src/project_kaizen/models/resources.py` - Pydantic models for resource schemas
- `src/project_kaizen/models/prompts.py` - Pydantic models for prompt templates
- **Test**: Resources queryable via MCP protocol, prompts generate dynamic workflows

**MCP Specification Alignment**:
- **Resources**: Context and data for user/AI model consumption (GET-like operations)
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for optimal tool/resource usage workflows
- **Dynamic Context**: Templates adapt to current workspace and project state

### **CHUNK 2.5: Security & Transport** [POST-MVP]

- `src/project_kaizen/transport.py` - Multi-transport support (STDIO + HTTP+SSE)
- `src/project_kaizen/security.py` - User consent flows and permission management
- **Test**: Authorization flows work, both transport methods functional

**Security Requirements** (per MCP 2025 spec):
- **User Consent**: Explicit approval for data access and tool execution
- **Authorization**: OAuth 2.1 subset with Resource Indicators (RFC 8707)
- **Data Privacy**: User control over data sharing and action authorization
- **Tool Safety**: Clear descriptions and consent for arbitrary code execution

### **CHUNK 5.5: Enhanced FastMCP Server** [POST-MVP]
**Purpose**: Upgrade server.py to support full MCP specification (Tools + Resources + Prompts)

- Enhanced `src/project_kaizen/main.py` - Multi-transport entry point with auth
- `src/project_kaizen/health.py` - Health checks and system monitoring
- `src/project_kaizen/middleware.py` - Rate limiting, error handling, request logging
- **Test**: Full MCP spec compliance, production readiness metrics

**Server Architecture**:
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("project-kaizen")

# Tools (current MVP implementation)
@mcp.tool()
async def get_task_context(...): ...

# Resources (new)
@mcp.resource()
async def knowledge_entries(...): ...

# Prompts (new)  
@mcp.prompt()
async def research_workflow(...): ...
```

### **CHUNK 8: Production Monitoring** [POST-MVP]
**Purpose**: Enterprise-grade monitoring, logging, and observability

**Deliverables**:
- `src/project_kaizen/monitoring.py` - Structured metrics and telemetry
- `src/project_kaizen/logging.py` - Enhanced with request tracing and audit trails
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production deployment with monitoring stack
- `monitoring/` - Grafana dashboards, Prometheus configs, alerting rules
- **Test**: Full observability stack, performance metrics, error tracking

**Monitoring Stack**:
- **Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates, database performance
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs and audit trails
- **Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing through knowledge retrieval pipeline
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for system health and performance degradation

### **CHUNK 9: Advanced Features** [POST-MVP]
**Purpose**: Advanced MCP capabilities and performance optimizations

**Deliverables**:
- `src/project_kaizen/sampling.py` - Client-side sampling support for agentic behaviors
- `src/project_kaizen/caching.py` - Intelligent caching for knowledge queries
- `src/project_kaizen/batch.py` - Batch processing for multi-query operations
- `src/project_kaizen/analytics.py` - Usage analytics and query optimization
- **Test**: Sampling workflows, cache performance, batch efficiency

**Advanced Capabilities**:
- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions
- **Intelligent Caching**: Redis-based caching with cache invalidation strategies
- **Query Optimization**: Automatic query rewriting and result ranking
- **Usage Analytics**: Query patterns, performance metrics, optimization suggestions

### **CHUNK 10: Integration Testing** [POST-MVP]
**Purpose**: Comprehensive integration testing for production deployment

**Deliverables**:
- `tests/integration/` - Full MCP protocol compliance tests
- `tests/performance/` - Load testing and performance benchmarks  
- `tests/security/` - Authorization flows and security validation
- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end workflow testing with real AI clients
- **Test**: Production readiness validation across all components

**Testing Coverage**:
- **MCP Compliance**: Protocol specification conformance testing
- **Performance**: Load testing with concurrent clients and large datasets
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data privacy validation
- **Integration**: Testing with Claude, OpenAI, and other MCP-compatible clients
